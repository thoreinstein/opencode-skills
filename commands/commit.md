# Commit Analysis

## Pre-flight Checks

Before analysis:

1. **Working tree state**: Run `git status --porcelain`
2. **Conflict markers**: Run `git diff --check`
3. **No rebase/merge in progress**: Verify no `.git/MERGE_HEAD` or `.git/REBASE_HEAD` exists
4. **GPG signing**: All commits MUST use `git commit -S`

If conflicts or rebase/merge in progress, abort and report.

---

## Repository State

Gather current state:

- `git status` — files changed
- `git diff` — unstaged changes
- `git diff --cached` — staged changes

---

## Staging Strategy

### Single-Concern Files

If a file's changes all belong to one logical unit:
- Stage the entire file: `git add <file>`

### Mixed-Concern Files (STOP AND ASK)

If a single file contains changes for multiple logical units (e.g., a bug fix AND a refactor):

1. **DO NOT stage the file**
2. **STOP and ask:** "File `<filename>` has mixed changes. Please run `git add -p <filename>` and stage only the hunks for [specific concern], then confirm when ready."
3. Wait for confirmation before proceeding
4. Repeat for remaining concerns in subsequent commits

**Never commit an entire file just because hunk staging is inconvenient.**

---

## Commit Ordering

Follow this sequence when dependencies exist:

1. **Dependencies** — `go.mod`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.
2. **Schema/migrations** — Database changes other code depends on
3. **Shared libraries** — Utilities, helpers, common code
4. **Core implementation** — The main feature/fix
5. **Tests** — With implementation if tightly coupled, otherwise after
6. **Documentation** — References final state

---

## Analysis Instructions

Analyze the changes and create a commit plan:

1. Group changes into atomic units (by feature, fix, or refactor)
2. **For each file, determine:** single-concern (auto-stage) or mixed-concern (manual staging required)
3. For each commit group:
   - List files to auto-stage
   - List files requiring manual hunk staging with specific guidance on which changes belong to this commit
4. Provide a commit message for each group:
   - **Subject:** Capital verb, 50 chars max, no period
   - **Body:** Required. Blank line after subject, wrapped at 72 chars. Explain _why_.
5. Note any dependencies between commits
6. Proceed with staging and committing, pausing for manual staging as needed

```
⚠️  DO NOT PUSH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
```

## Implementation Workflow Integration

If this commit is part of `/implement`:

1. Verify phase work is complete before committing
2. After commit succeeds, mark relevant tasks as done
3. Do NOT proceed to next phase until commit succeeds
