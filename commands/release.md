# Release Authoring

## Pre-flight Checks

1. **Clean tree required**: Run `git status --porcelain` — if not empty, ABORT and report dirty state
2. **Identify last tag**: Run `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null` — if none, start at v0.1.0
3. **Review changes**: Run `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline` (or full history if no tags)

---

## Semver Selection

Analyze commits since the last tag to determine version bump:

| Bump  | Criteria                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Major** | Breaking changes, backwards-incompatible behavior, `BREAKING CHANGE` |
| **Minor** | New features, notable enhancements, `feat:`                          |
| **Patch** | Bug fixes, docs, refactors, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`                    |

Base the increment on the **highest-impact change** observed.

---

## Analysis

For each significant commit:

1. Inspect with `git show --stat --name-only <sha>`
2. Classify by domain (backend, frontend, infra, security, etc.)
3. Note user-facing changes, breaking changes, migrations

---

## Artifacts to Create

### 1. RELEASE_NOTES.md

Prepend a new section covering:

- **Summary**: High-level scope of the release
- **Breaking Changes**: Migration steps if any
- **New Features**: User-facing additions
- **Bug Fixes**: Issues resolved
- **Operations**: Config changes, deployment notes, rollback considerations

### 2. CHANGELOG.md

Prepend a new section with:

- Version and date header
- Bulleted list of commits: `- <short-sha> <subject>`
- Group by type if helpful (Features, Fixes, etc.)

---

## Execution Sequence

```
Draft → Write → Commit → Tag
```

1. **Draft**: Prepare release notes and changelog content
2. **Write**: Update RELEASE_NOTES.md and CHANGELOG.md
3. **Stage**: `git add CHANGELOG.md RELEASE_NOTES.md`
4. **Commit**: `git commit -S -m "chore(release): prepare release $VERSION"`
5. **Tag**: `git tag -s "$VERSION" -m "Release $VERSION"`

**The tag MUST point to the commit containing the release notes and changelog.**

```
⚠️  CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

- All commits MUST be GPG signed (-S)
- All tags MUST be signed (-s)
- NO CI-skip directives ([skip ci], [ci skip]) in commit messages
- DO NOT PUSH — user pushes the tag manually after review
```

---

## Output

1. State the calculated version and reasoning
2. Show the release notes and changelog content
3. Execute: write files → stage → commit → tag (in that order)
4. **STOP** — do not push

---

## DO NOT PUSH

> **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY YOU PUSH TO THE REMOTE.**
>
> The release workflow is triggered by the user pushing the signed tag manually.
> Pushing prematurely can trigger broken releases or bypass review gates.
>
> **STOP AFTER TAG CREATION.**
