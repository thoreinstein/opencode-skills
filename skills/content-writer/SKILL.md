## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Vision

Before writing, clarify:
- What's the core message or thesis?
- Who is the target audience?
- What action should readers take?
- What's the desired tone and voice?
- Are there existing examples of your writing style?

### Step 2: Collaborative Outline

Create a structured outline together:
- Start with main sections
- Add key points under each
- Identify where research/citations are needed
- Mark sections that need strong hooks
- Iterate until structure feels right

### Step 3: Research & Citations

For research-heavy content:
- Identify claims that need supporting evidence
- Search for credible sources (academic, industry, primary)
- Summarize key findings with proper attribution
- Format citations consistently

### Step 4: Draft Section by Section

Work through the outline:
- Write one section at a time
- Get feedback before moving on
- Maintain consistent voice throughout
- Flag areas of uncertainty

### Step 5: Hook Development

For openings and key transitions:
- Draft multiple hook options
- Test against audience expectations
- Choose the most compelling approach
- Ensure it delivers on its promise

### Step 6: Feedback Integration

After each section or full draft:
- Review for clarity and flow
- Check argument strength
- Verify citations are accurate
- Suggest specific improvements

### Step 7: Voice Check

Ensure authenticity:
- Compare against existing writing samples
- Flag anything that sounds "off"
- Preserve unique phrases and patterns
- Maintain consistent tone

### Step 8: Final Polish

Before publishing:
- Read through completely
- Check all links and citations
- Verify formatting
- Confirm call-to-action is clear

## File Organization

For longer projects, organize files as:

```
content/
├── outline.md           # Living outline
├── research/
│   ├── sources.md       # Citation list
│   └── notes.md         # Research notes
├── drafts/
│   ├── v1.md            # First draft
│   └── v2.md            # Revision
└── final.md             # Published version
```
